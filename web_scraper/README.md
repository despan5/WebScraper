# Overview

This is a basic web scraper program to see how many times a chosen word is used within a website.

I wrote this to learn the Rust language, and too see how it can interact with websites and data.

# Development Environment

This software was created in VS Code using the basic Rust package. It is run using the terminal on the machine.

I used Rust as the programming language. Within that I used the Document, Name, Error, IO, Duration, and HashMap packages.
